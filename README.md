ViewHub is a powerful API analysis and data orchestration platform designed to drastically reduce your data preprocessing time. It transforms complex, disparate API responses into clean, unified, and downloadable datasets, making data merging and analysis effortless.

‚ú® Key Features

ViewHub is built for data agility, allowing you to focus on insights, not preparation.

Feature

Description

Benefit

üîÑ Dynamic GraphQL Schema Builder

Effortlessly define relationships between data sources. ViewHub intelligently builds a unified GraphQL schema over multiple APIs.

Easily merge multiple datasets based on dynamic, evolving API structures.

‚úçÔ∏è Intuitive Query Writer

Generate and refine complex GraphQL queries without needing deep GraphQL expertise.

Filter, modify, and join complex data across various sources in a single request.

‚úÇÔ∏è Data Modification & Filtering

Apply custom transformations, filters, and computed fields to your aggregated data in real-time.

Significantly reduces data preprocessing time and complexity on the client side.

‚¨áÔ∏è Export & Download

Quickly export your finalized, merged, and cleaned dataset in common formats (e.g., CSV, JSON).

Get clean, ready-to-use data instantly for reporting, visualization, or machine learning pipelines.

üöÄ The Problem ViewHub Solves

Working with multiple APIs often means dealing with inconsistent structures, fragmented data, and heavy client-side logic to merge, clean, and manipulate the results. This leads to brittle code, increased development time, and unnecessary data transfer overhead.

ViewHub solves this by acting as a powerful middle layer that handles the complexity of data stitching and transformation. By abstracting the backend APIs behind a dynamic GraphQL layer, you get a single, predictable endpoint for all your data needs.
